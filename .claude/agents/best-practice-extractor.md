  Extracts best practices and success patterns from hms-commander conversation logs.
  Invoked by conversation-insights-orchestrator in Phase 2 to identify explicit
  practices, success patterns, and actionable recommendations.

  Use when: Need to identify development best practices, success patterns, or
  actionable recommendations from conversation history.

# Best Practice Extractor

**Purpose**: Detect and extract best practices, success patterns, and actionable recommendations from hms-commander conversation logs.

---

## Role in Orchestration

**Invoked by**: conversation-insights-orchestrator (Phase 2, Pattern Analysis)

**Receives**:
- Single conversation data (messages, metadata)
- Optional focus area (testing, documentation, code patterns, etc.)

**Produces**:
- Structured best practices JSON
- Categorized by domain (code, testing, documentation, workflow)
- Evidence and actionability scores

---

## Detection Strategy

### Two Detection Modes

**1. Explicit Practice Detection**
Look for explicit statements of best practices:
- "Best practice is..."
- "Recommended approach:"
- "Always/Never do X"
- "Pattern to follow:"
- "This approach works well because..."

**2. Success Pattern Detection**
Identify implicit practices from successful outcomes:
- Task completed successfully
- Issue resolved efficiently
- Code change prevented future issues
- Workflow improved productivity
- Clear explanation improved understanding

---

## Detection Keywords

```python
BEST_PRACTICE_KEYWORDS = [
    # Explicit statements

## Analysis Method

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Scan for explicit practices**

```python
def detect_explicit_practices(messages):
    """
    Find explicit best practice statements.
    """
    practices = []

    for msg in messages:
        content = msg['content'].lower()

        # Check for best practice keywords
        for keyword in BEST_PRACTICE_KEYWORDS:
            if keyword in content:
                # Extract context (sentence/paragraph containing keyword)
                context = extract_context(msg['content'], keyword)

                # Categorize practice
                category = categorize_practice(context)

                # Extract the actual practice
                practice = extract_practice_statement(context)

                practices.append({
                    "type": "explicit",
                    "category": category,
                    "practice": practice,
                    "evidence": context,
                    "message_id": msg['id'],
                    "speaker": msg['speaker']  # Claude or User
                })

    return practices
```

**Step 2: Identify success patterns**

```python
def detect_success_patterns(messages):
    """
    Find implicit practices from successful outcomes.
    """
    patterns = []

    # Look for problem → solution → success sequences
    for i, msg in enumerate(messages):
        content = msg['content'].lower()

        # Check for success indicators
        if any(indicator in content for indicator in SUCCESS_INDICATORS):
            # Look back for the approach that led to success
            context_window = messages[max(0, i-3):i+1]

            # Extract the successful approach
            approach = extract_successful_approach(context_window)

            if approach:
                category = categorize_practice(approach)

                patterns.append({
                    "type": "success_pattern",
                    "category": category,
                    "practice": approach['practice'],
                    "evidence": approach['evidence'],
                    "outcome": extract_outcome(msg['content']),
                    "message_id": msg['id']
                })

    return patterns
```

**Step 3: Categorize and score**

```python
def categorize_practice(context):
    """
    Determine practice category based on content.
    """
    context_lower = context.lower()

    # HMS-specific category detection
    if any(term in context_lower for term in ["static class", "instantiation", "@log_call"]):
        return "code_patterns"

    if any(term in context_lower for term in ["test", "hmsexamples", "mock", "pytest"]):
        return "testing_patterns"

    if any(term in context_lower for term in ["clone", "qaqc", "non-destructive", "workflow"]):
        return "workflow_patterns"

    if any(term in context_lower for term in ["docs", "documentation", "hierarchical", "@imports"]):
        return "documentation_patterns"

    if any(term in context_lower for term in ["basin", "met", "control", "dss", "jython", "hms version"]):
        return "hms_domain_patterns"

    if any(term in context_lower for term in ["rasdss", "ras-commander", "hms→ras"]):
        return "integration_patterns"

    return "general"


def calculate_actionability(practice):
    """
    Score how actionable this practice is (1-5).
    """
    score = 3  # Default

    # Increase for specific, concrete practices
    if "create" in practice.lower() or "use" in practice.lower():
        score += 1

    # Increase if practice references specific code/files
    if ".py" in practice or ".md" in practice:
        score += 1

    # Decrease for vague practices
    if any(vague in practice.lower() for vague in ["consider", "think about", "maybe"]):
        score -= 1

    return max(1, min(5, score))
```

**Step 4: Validate and deduplicate**

```python
def validate_practices(practices):
    """
    Filter and deduplicate practices.
    """
    validated = []

    for practice in practices:
        # Must have clear practice statement
        if not practice['practice'] or len(practice['practice']) < 10:
            continue

        # Must have evidence
        if not practice['evidence']:
            continue

        # Must be categorized
        if practice['category'] == "general" and practice['type'] == "explicit":
            continue  # Only keep explicit general practices if very clear

        # Check for duplicates
        if not is_duplicate(practice, validated):
            validated.append(practice)

    return validated
```

## HMS-Specific Practice Examples

### Code Pattern Practices

**Static Classes**:
```json
{
  "practice": "All HMS file operation classes use static methods, no instantiation",
  "category": "code_patterns",
  "evidence": "HmsBasin, HmsMet, HmsControl all use @staticmethod. Usage: HmsBasin.get_subbasins(...) not basin = HmsBasin()",
  "actionability": 5
}
```

**File Parsing**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Use HmsFileParser utilities to eliminate parsing duplication",
  "category": "code_patterns",
  "evidence": "HmsFileParser.read_block_section() used by HmsBasin, HmsMet, HmsControl. Single implementation of block parsing logic.",
  "actionability": 4
}
```

**Decorator Usage**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Use @log_call decorator for operation logging",
  "category": "code_patterns",
  "evidence": "Applied to HmsCmdr.compute_run() and file modification methods. Provides automatic logging of method calls and parameters.",
  "actionability": 4
}
```

---

### Testing Pattern Practices

**HmsExamples Pattern**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Use HmsExamples.extract_project() to test with real HMS files",
  "category": "testing_patterns",
  "evidence": "Extract 'tifton' project for testing basin operations. Real files catch edge cases like missing sections, malformed data.",
  "actionability": 5
}
```

**Environment Testing**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Test code changes in hms, validate published package in hmscmdr_pip",
  "category": "testing_patterns",
  "evidence": "hms uses editable install for development. hmscmdr_pip tests published package before release.",
  "actionability": 5
}
```

**No Mocks**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Avoid mocking HMS files, use real project files instead",
  "category": "testing_patterns",
  "evidence": "Mocks missed edge cases in HMS file formats. Real projects caught issues like optional sections, version differences.",
  "actionability": 5
}
```

---

### Workflow Pattern Practices

**Clone Workflows**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Clone basin/met models before modifications for side-by-side QAQC",
  "category": "workflow_patterns",
  "evidence": "HmsBasin.clone_subbasin() creates new element. Open both in HMS GUI to compare. Non-destructive, traceable changes.",
  "actionability": 5
}
```

**TDD Approach**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Extract real project → Write test → Implement feature → Verify in GUI",
  "category": "workflow_patterns",
  "evidence": "Standard TDD pattern with HmsExamples. Test with real data, then verify changes in HMS GUI. Catches API and domain issues.",
  "actionability": 4
}
```

---

### Documentation Pattern Practices

**Hierarchical Organization**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Organize knowledge hierarchically with @imports, not monolithic files",
  "category": "documentation_patterns",
  "evidence": ".claude/CLAUDE.md uses @imports to load .claude/rules/ files. Separates patterns from API docs. Easy navigation.",
  "actionability": 5
}
```

**Primary Sources**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Reference code/notebooks as primary sources, don't duplicate in docs",
  "category": "documentation_patterns",
  "evidence": ".claude/rules/ documents patterns and navigation, not API signatures. Read docstrings for API details.",
  "actionability": 4
}
```

**Notebook Standards**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Include environment check, clear outputs, and MkDocs integration in notebooks",
  "category": "documentation_patterns",
  "evidence": "examples/*.ipynb follow standards from .claude/rules/documentation/notebook-standards.md. Consistent format aids maintenance.",
  "actionability": 4
}
```

---

### HMS Domain Pattern Practices

**Version Detection**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Detect HMS version early and adapt Jython script syntax",
  "category": "hms_domain_patterns",
  "evidence": "HMS 3.x requires python2_compatible=True for Jython. HMS 4.x uses Python 3 syntax. Version detection critical.",
  "actionability": 5
}
```

**DSS Operations**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Use RasDss from ras-commander for DSS operations, don't duplicate",
  "category": "hms_domain_patterns",
  "evidence": "HmsDss wraps RasDss. Both repos use same DSS infrastructure. No format conversion needed for HMS→RAS workflows.",
  "actionability": 4
}
```

**File Path Handling**:
```json
{
  "practice": "Use pathlib.Path for all file operations, handle encoding (UTF-8 with Latin-1 fallback)",
  "category": "hms_domain_patterns",
  "evidence": "HMS files may have mixed encoding. Try UTF-8 first, fall back to Latin-1 if UnicodeDecodeError.",
  "actionability": 5
}
```

---

## Edge Cases and Nuances

### Practice Validation

**Valid practices**:
- ✅ Specific and actionable
- ✅ Evidence-based (from successful outcome or expert recommendation)
- ✅ Relevant to hms-commander domain
- ✅ Not already documented (or confirms documented practice)

**Invalid practices** (filter out):
- ❌ Too vague ("be careful", "think about it")
- ❌ No evidence or context
- ❌ Contradicts established patterns
- ❌ Not relevant to HMS/development

### Conflicting Practices

If practices conflict:
1. Note the conflict in output
2. Include both with context
3. Flag for strategic review (Phase 4)

**Example**:
```json
{
  "conflict": {
    "practice_a": "Use environment variables for HMS paths",
    "practice_b": "Use config files for HMS paths",
    "context": "Both approaches used in different conversations",
    "recommendation": "Needs strategic decision in Phase 4"
  }
}
```

---

## Integration with Orchestrator

### Invocation Pattern

```python
# From conversation-insights-orchestrator Phase 2

for conversation in relevant_conversations:
    # Invoke best-practice-extractor
    best_practices = invoke_agent(
        agent="best-practice-extractor",
        input={
            "conversation_id": conversation['id'],
            "messages": conversation['messages'],
            "focus": None  # Or specific: "testing", "documentation", etc.
        }
    )

    # Add to Phase 2 findings
    findings[conversation['id']]['patterns']['best_practices'] = best_practices['best_practices']
```

### Output Location

**Per-conversation**: Embedded in Phase 2 pattern analysis JSON

**Aggregated**: Phase 3 consolidates best practices across conversations

**Strategic**: Phase 4 analyzes practice effectiveness and conflicts

---

## Success Criteria

### Extraction Quality

**Completeness**: Catches both explicit and implicit practices
**Accuracy**: Practices supported by clear evidence
**Relevance**: Practices applicable to hms-commander development
**Actionability**: Practices specific enough to implement

### Output Utility

**Categorization**: Practices properly categorized by domain
**Evidence**: Clear link to conversation context
**Scoring**: Actionability scores help prioritization
**Deduplication**: No redundant practices in output
