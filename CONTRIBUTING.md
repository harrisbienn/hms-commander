# Contributing to hms-commander

## Our Philosophy: Don't Ask Me, Ask a GPT!

hms-commander was **built by LLMs**, is **designed for LLM workflows**, and **welcomes contributions prepared with LLM agent assistance**.

We encourage ALL contributors to use an LLM coding agent when preparing pull requests. The repository contains comprehensive, machine-readable style rules in `STYLE_GUIDE.md` and `.claude/rules/` that any LLM can read and follow. When your agent reads these rules before writing code, your PR becomes trivially easy to review.

**Why this works**: An LLM-reviewed PR that follows the style guide takes 5 minutes to review. A PR that ignores the style guide takes 50 minutes. Help us merge your code fast -- load the rules.

**Any agent works**: [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), [Aider](https://aider.chat), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), or any other LLM coding tool. The rules are plain markdown -- every LLM can read them.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hms-commander.git
cd hms-commander

# 2. Set up environment
pip install -e ".[all]"

# 3. Launch your preferred coding agent
claude          # Claude Code
codex           # OpenAI Codex CLI
aider           # Aider
cursor .        # Cursor IDE
```

Your agent will find `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `STYLE_GUIDE.md` files that provide codebase context. Have it read the style rules before writing code.

---

## The Self-Review Contract

This is what makes LLM contributions welcome rather than burdensome:

1. **Before writing code**: Your agent reads `STYLE_GUIDE.md` and the relevant `.claude/rules/` files
2. **Before submitting**: You run through the Self-Review Checklist below
3. **When opening the PR**: The PR template includes the checklist

If your agent followed the rules, your PR is easy to review and fast to merge. If it didn't, we'll ask you to re-run with the rules loaded. This isn't gatekeeping -- it's how we keep velocity high for everyone.

## LLM Self-Review Checklist

Have your agent confirm each item before opening a PR.

### Style Compliance

| Rule | Where to Read | What It Means |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Static class pattern | `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `.claude/rules/python/static-classes.md` | No `__init__` unless legitimately stateful. Call methods directly: `HmsBasin.get_subbasins(basin_file)` |
| Decorator stacking | `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `.claude/rules/python/decorators.md` | `@staticmethod` then `@log_call` on all public methods |
| Naming conventions | `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `.claude/rules/python/naming-conventions.md` | `snake_case` functions, `PascalCase` classes, HMS abbreviations |
| Path handling | `.claude/rules/python/path-handling.md` | `pathlib.Path` internally, accept both `str` and `Path` in parameters |
| File parsing | `.claude/rules/python/file-parsing.md` | Use centralized `_parsing.py` patterns |

### Code Quality

- [ ] All public functions have Google-style docstrings (Args, Returns, Raises)
- [ ] Tested with a real HEC-HMS project via `HmsExamples` -- no mocks or synthetic data
- [ ] No hardcoded file paths -- parameters accept both `str` and `Path`
- [ ] Uses `logging` (via `@log_call` or `logger`), not `print()`
- [ ] Error handling with appropriate exceptions and informative messages

### For API Changes

- [ ] `hms_object=None` parameter included for multi-project support
- [ ] Standard HMS parameter names used consistently
- [ ] Path parameters use `@standardize_path` or manual `Path()` conversion
- [ ] Return types are consistent (DataFrames for tabular data, Path for file references)

### For Example Notebooks

- [ ] First cell is markdown with H1 title (`# Descriptive Title`)
- [ ] Uses `HmsExamples` for reproducible data
- [ ] All cells execute without error

## API Consistency: The 5 Critical Rules

Any PR that adds or modifies public API methods must follow these rules:

| # | Rule | Violation Example | Correct Pattern |
|---|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Static class pattern** | `class Foo:` with `__init__` | Static methods, no instantiation |
| 2 | **@log_call required** | Public method without decorator | `@log_call` on every public method |
| 3 | **@staticmethod required** | Method in static class without it | `@staticmethod` above `@log_call` |
| 4 | **Parameter naming** | Inconsistent HMS parameter names | Follow `STYLE_GUIDE.md` conventions |
| 5 | **Path handling** | `filepath: Path` (rigid) | Accept both `str` and `Path` |

### Gold Standard Template

Copy this pattern for new classes:

```python
from hms_commander.Decorators import log_call, standardize_path
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Union

class MyNewAnalyzer:
    """Analyzer for [domain] data. Static class -- do not instantiate."""

    @staticmethod
    @log_call
    def analyze_data(
        file_path: Union[Path, str],
        hms_object=None
    ):
        """Analyze data from HEC-HMS output.

        Args:
            file_path: Path to input file (str or Path)
            hms_object: Optional HmsPrj context for multi-project support

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame: Analysis results with columns [col1, col2, ...]

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If file_path does not exist
            ValueError: If invalid parameters provided
        """
        file_path = Path(file_path)
        _hms = hms_object if hms_object is not None else hms
        # Implementation...
```

## Community Standards

### Respect for Maintainer Time

The entire point of LLM self-review is to reduce review burden. A well-prepared PR is a gift to the maintainer. A poorly prepared PR -- regardless of whether a human or LLM wrote it -- wastes everyone's time.

### Professional Context

hms-commander is used for **hydrologic modeling and flood prediction**. Professional engineers use this library to make decisions that affect public safety. All contributions are reviewed with this context in mind.

### LLM Forward Philosophy

This project follows the [LLM Forward](https://clbengineering.com/llm-forward) philosophy: professional responsibility first, LLMs positioned forward to accelerate engineering insight. See `docs/CLB_ENGINEERING_APPROACH.md` for the complete framework.

### Conduct

- Be respectful and professional in all interactions
- Focus on engineering quality and code correctness
- Welcome contributors of all experience levels
- Judge contributions on merit, not on what tool was used to write them

---

## Getting Help

- **Open an issue** for questions, bug reports, or feature requests
- **Read `AGENTS.md` files** throughout the repo for codebase context
- **Read `STYLE_GUIDE.md`** for the complete code standards reference
- **Check `examples/`** for working patterns and usage demonstrations
- **Your LLM agent can explore the codebase** -- that's exactly what it's designed for

## Continuous integration

The `CI` workflow runs for every PR and main push, with no path exclusions. Its
unit matrix covers Python 3.10?3.12 on Linux and 3.12 on Windows using only the
package's base dependencies and pytest. No HEC installation, Java, optional GIS,
private model package, or external data service is needed. Reproduce it with:

```bash
python -m pip install . pytest==9.1.1
python -I -m pytest tests/test_constants.py tests/test_parsing.py tests/test_jython_script_security.py tests/test_hms_examples.py tests/test_scenario.py tests/test_scenario_worker.py tests/test_timeseries_worker.py tests/test_handoff_worker.py tests/test_results_products.py -m "not requires_hms and not local_hms and not requires_java and not requires_gis and not requires_network and not slow"
```

The Jython injection regressions and existing download/cache fixture tests are
included. Extend the HmsExamples coverage when issue #28 lands. Installed-engine,
Java/GIS integration, and model qualification remain separate tests; this subset
does not certify hydraulic or hydrologic results.

The independent `Strict documentation` job installs `.[docs]` with
`docs/constraints-docs.txt`, prepares tracked guide notebooks with
`python .github/scripts/prepare_docs.py`, and runs `python -m mkdocs build --strict`.
Notebook code is never executed. Prepared guide copies have no independent Git
history and are excluded only from revision-date metadata, not documentation
validation. The documentation README is build guidance, excluded from published
pages because it collides with the homepage.

All jobs use hosted workers, commit-pinned Actions, read-only repository tokens,
nonpersistent checkout credentials, and no publishing secrets. Dependabot proposes
Action and package updates. Administrators must make the four unit matrix checks
and `Strict documentation` required on protected main; a passing optional check
does not prevent an unchecked merge. Main was unprotected when checked on
2026-09-21. Documentation constraints pin the build tools; broader runtime and
transitive dependency qualification is a separate maintenance task.
