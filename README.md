**[📖 Full Documentation](https://rascommander.info/hms/)** | **[CLB Engineering](https://clbengineering.com/)**

> **Beta Software - Engineering Oversight Required**
>
> This library is in active development and should be used with caution. Many workflows have only been tested with HEC-HMS example projects, not production watersheds.
>
> **Real-world hydrologic modeling requires professional engineering judgment.** Every watershed has unique characteristics and nuances that automated workflows cannot fully capture. AI agent workflows are tools to assist engineers, not replace them.
>
> **Human-in-the-Loop is essential.** Licensed Professional Engineers must pilot these systems, guide their application, and verify all outputs before use in engineering decisions. Always validate results against established engineering practices and local knowledge.

## Why HMS Commander?

**HMS→RAS linked models are an industry standard** for watershed-to-river hydraulic analysis, yet there is no straightforward way to automate the linkage between HEC-HMS (hydrology) and HEC-RAS (hydraulics).

This library exists to **bridge that gap**—extending the [ras-commander](https://github.com/gpt-cmdr/ras-commander) effort for HEC-RAS automation to include HEC-HMS workflows. While HEC-HMS provides robust internal functionality for standalone hydrologic models, the real power emerges when HMS hydrographs flow into RAS hydraulic models for flood inundation mapping, bridge analysis, and infrastructure design.

**HMS Commander enables:**
- Automated HMS simulation execution and results extraction
- DSS file operations for seamless HMS→RAS boundary condition transfer
- Atlas 14, Frequency Storm, and SCS Type storm generation with DataFrame outputs
- AORC download, DSS grid conversion, grid-definition, and HRAP cell mapping helpers
- TauDEM-derived HMS basin/scaffold assembly and validation workflows
- Consistent API patterns across both HMS and RAS automation
- LLM-assisted workflows for complex multi-model scenarios

**LLM Forward Hydrologic Modeling Automation**

A Python library for automating HEC-HMS operations, built using [CLB Engineering's LLM Forward Approach](https://clbengineering.com/llm-forward). Within two years, CLB Engineering built the **most robust and feature-complete HEC-RAS and HEC-HMS automation solution on the open internet** using LLM Forward approaches -- proving that licensed professional engineers working alongside Large Language Models can create extraordinary value in compressed timeframes.

## LLM Forward Approach

</a>

This library was developed using the **[LLM Forward](https://clbengineering.com/llm-forward)** approach -- a framework pioneered by [CLB Engineering Corporation](https://clbengineering.com/) for responsible adoption of Large Language Models in professional engineering practice. LLM Forward places professional responsibility first while positioning LLMs forward to accelerate insight and automation.

**Core Tenets:**
- **Professional Responsibility First** -- Public safety, ethics, and licensure remain paramount
- **LLMs Forward (Not First)** -- Technology accelerates engineering insight without replacing professional judgment
- **Multi-Level Verifiability** -- HEC-HMS GUI review + visual outputs + code audit trails
- **Human-in-the-Loop** -- Licensed professionals in responsible charge at all times

See the [CLB Engineering LLM Forward Approach](docs/CLB_ENGINEERING_APPROACH.md) for full philosophy and best practices.

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes in v0.2.0

**Precipitation hyetograph methods now return DataFrame instead of ndarray**

If upgrading from v0.1.x, note that `Atlas14Storm`, `FrequencyStorm`, and `ScsTypeStorm` now return `pd.DataFrame` with columns `['hour', 'incremental_depth', 'cumulative_depth']` instead of `np.ndarray`.

**Quick Migration:**
```python
# OLD (v0.1.x)
hyeto = Atlas14Storm.generate_hyetograph(total_depth_inches=17.0, ...)
total = hyeto.sum()
peak = hyeto.max()

# NEW (v0.2.0+)
hyeto = Atlas14Storm.generate_hyetograph(total_depth_inches=17.0, ...)
total = hyeto['cumulative_depth'].iloc[-1]
peak = hyeto['incremental_depth'].max()
```

**Why this change?** Standardizes API for HMS→RAS integration and includes time axis.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for complete migration guide.

## Features

- **Project Management**: Initialize and manage HEC-HMS projects with DataFrames
- **File Operations**: Read and modify basin, met, control, and gage files
- **Simulation Execution**: Run HEC-HMS via Jython scripts (single, batch, parallel)
- **Results Analysis**: Extract peak flows, volumes, hydrograph statistics
- **DSS Integration**: Read/write DSS files (via ras-commander)
- **GIS Extraction**: Export model elements to GeoJSON
- **Clone Operations**: Non-destructive model cloning for QAQC workflows

## Current TauDEM/HMS Status

The repo now includes a full Spring Creek benchmark path for:

- gauge-first study packaging and report/data-gap regeneration
- direct TauDEM preprocessing and delineation manifests
- watershed verification and boundary handoff selection
- TauDEM-to-HMS basin/scaffold assembly with SQLite geometry
- clone-first HEC-HMS parser-of-record round-trip validation
- Atlas 14 storm bootstrap and a live compute demonstration

That workflow is now import-valid and compute-valid, but it is not yet production-ready. The first live HMS run still surfaces residual modeling warnings that must be handled deliberately: missing ET/canopy methods, Muskingum stability warnings, lag-vs-time-step warnings, and negative inflow clipping. The current roadmap therefore adds three gating items before generated HMS projects should be promoted as defensible engineering setups:

- a machine-readable pre-HMS readiness gate
- TauDEM parameter sensitivity / optimization support for delineation controls
- a human-review QAQC bundle and explicit signoff workflow
